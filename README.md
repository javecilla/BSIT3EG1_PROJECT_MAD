# ðŸŽ¯ FocusFlow Study Companion: Capstone Project (IT 306 - Mobile Application Development)

This repository hosts the source code and documentation for the **FocusFlow Study Companion**, the final project developed to fulfill the completion requirements for the **IT 306W (Mobile Application Development 1)** subject.

This project is a strategic implementation of core Android development concepts, focusing heavily on **Activity lifecycle management** and **transient data handling** without the use of persistent databases.

---

## Project Objectives & Core Requirements

The application successfully integrates the following non-negotiable requirements, demonstrating proficiency in fundamental Android Java development:

1.  **Login Activity (ACT #3):** Secure entry point for the application.
2.  **Registration Activity (ACT #4 and ACT #5):** User onboarding with necessary input validation.
3.  **Feature Implementation (Unit 3 - 7 Mastery):** The core application featureâ€”setting a single focus goalâ€”must strictly rely on passing data between Activities using **`Intent.putExtra`** and the **`startActivityForResult`** callback mechanism. **No database or persistent storage is utilized.**
4.  **Creative UI/UX:** The application features a creative, appealing, and user-centric interface.
5.  **Video Advertisement:** A minimum 45-second promotional video showcasing the app's functionality and value proposition.
